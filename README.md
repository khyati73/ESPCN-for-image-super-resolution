# ESPCN-for-image-super-resolution
Efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural networks can be used for both images and videos.  ESPCN (Efficient Subpixel CNN), is a model that reconstructs a high-resolution version of an image given a low-resolution version. The ‘array’ of image upscaling filters are learned by efficient sub-pixel convolution layers.
